**App Logo/Icon colors:**

#d7282e \
ipa-iTunesArtwork.png - looks like theres some artifacting on the edges within the red, possibly saved as a jpeg at one point? white color measures as #feffff in pixelmator and sketch but not preview? extra metadata (exif/jfif?) included within it?

#d9272e \
app-AppIconFredMeyer76x76@2x~ipad.png -- looks pretty good, no grey outline \
app-AppIconFredMeyer60x60@2x.png -- grey single-pixel outline on right and bottom \

iOS-app-store-icon-1024x1024_Normal.png -- looks good, better than the actual iTunesArtwork.png in the .ipa \
ZZZZPackedAsset-1.1_Normal.png -- not quite sure what the packed asset is, maybe a pdf with multiple icon sizes? black outline around the whole collection, not sure if its a side effect of trying to extract the assets. most of the icons in this are good but the smallest one has a grey outline on the right and bottom. \
ZZZZPackedAsset-2.1_Normal@2x.png -- grey outline on right and bottom of the largest icon. \

#fffffe -- these probably were meant to be completely white, they all just slightly off though. I'd also remove the super-small unrecognizable registered trademark symbol. we shouldn't need to include it in any logo. fred meyer and kroger are established brands and logos no need to clutter up the legibility of the logo with it. \

80x80_White_FredMeyer_Normal@2x.png \
80x80_White_FredMeyer_Normal@3x.png

#ffffff -- color looks good on these, but I would also remove the registered trademark and trademark symbols, just makes it harder to visually scan and read. Also they are kind of large, not sure where they're being displayed but depending on that it might be possible to reduce the size of them. \
